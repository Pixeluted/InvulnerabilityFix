# InvulnerabilityFix

This mod address the issue, in a heavily modded modpack.

If you are loading into the game too long, some mobs could kill you until you are loaded into the game. Well this mod fixes it by waiting for you to move before removing the invulnerability.

It is currently only for forge, and version 1.19.2!
